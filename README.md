##Future features:

* Remove intercept dependency on running the regression.

* Don't display strings as variable choices.

* Unkludgeify the damn slider input.

* Add scatterplotMatrix to Current Model tab.

* Add linebreaks to the sidebar and otherwise prettify it.

* Keep all the used variables in the pplot, freezing their partial correlation to its value when it was included.
